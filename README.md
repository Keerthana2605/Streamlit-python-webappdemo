# Streamlit-python-webappdemo
Created a webapp with the help of streamlit, python and vs code. 

treamlit is an open source app framework in Python language. It helps us create web apps for data science and machine learning in a short time. It is compatible with major Python libraries such as scikit-learn, Keras, PyTorch, SymPy(latex), NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib etc. With Streamlit, no callbacks are needed since widgets are treated as variables.

1)create a new folder
2)create a newfile name.py
3)open file in VS code (in anaconda) (my choice, any IDE can be used)
4)in teminal: pip install streamlit
5)to run the app use command prompt : cd "to where the folder is create"
6)type: streamlit run name.py
7)empty app will open in the loacl host
8)save as you code, rerun the app to see results.

The Streamlit app is pretty simple to use and can be helpful to create minimal dynamic webapps fast.
